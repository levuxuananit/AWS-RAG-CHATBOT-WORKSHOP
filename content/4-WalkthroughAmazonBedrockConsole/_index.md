### Introducing Amazon Bedrock
Use Amazon Bedrock to build and scale generative AI applications with FM. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes FMs from leading AI startups and Amazon available via API. You can choose from a variety of FMs to find the model that best fits your use case. With Amazon Bedrockâ€™s serverless experience, you can get started quickly, customize private FMs with your own data, and quickly integrate and deploy them into your applications using AWS tools without managing any infrastructure.
