### Launch a workshop using a CloudFormation template
AWS CloudFormation templates are used to set up resources in the AWS Region you choose. CloudFormation templates create the following AWS resources:
- **VSCode**: VSCode on Amazon EC2 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to write, run, and debug your code using just your browser. It includes a code editor, a debugger, and a terminal. In this workshop, you use the VSCode editor to deploy a backend application, which is built using the **AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)** and also implements the **AWS Amplify** interface.
- **Amazon S3**: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that provides industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile applications. In this workshop, you use S3 buckets to upload documents focused on your use case.
  
1. Download [CloudFormation template](https://static.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/public/c5c516a7-10ce-444b-a0c5-1e60794fdb7c/static/template/chatbot-startup-stack.yaml)
2. Save the YAML template file to a folder on your local machine.
3. Navigate to [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
4. In the CloudFormation console, select Upload Template File.
5. Select the template you just downloaded, and then select **Next**.

9. To deploy the template, select **Submit**
10.  Once the template is deployed, to review the resources you created, navigate to [CloudFormation Resources](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?/stacks/resources?) , and then select the CloudFormation stack you created.
